## React Weather App
    This web application is designed to provide weather information for cities. It utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API as a data source and Axios for retrieving data. Efforts were made to implement responsive design throughout the project within a limited timeframe. Users can search for city names to discover temperature, wind speed, and general weather descriptions for specific cities. Additionally, icons dynamically change based on the data fetched from the API.
